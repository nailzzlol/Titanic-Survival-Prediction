## A Machine Learning Approach to Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features like gender, age, fare, and class.

---

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
We used the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), which includes features such as:
- PassengerId
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked
- Survived (label)

---

### ðŸ§  Models Used
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**

Both models were trained using `sklearn` and evaluated using accuracy.

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Decision Tree Accuracy**: ~69%
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~79%

---

### ðŸ“Œ Visualizations
We included data visualizations to understand survival patterns based on:
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Overall survival counts

Plots were generated using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

---

### ðŸ’» How to Run
1. Download the repository or open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`) is in the same folder.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to view results and visualizations.
